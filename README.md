# armstrong-homework1-coderefactor-correctingsemantichtmlandcss


This project involved updating an existing code to meet accesibility standards, semantic formatting, and increasing usability. One of the main accesibility features missing was "alt" descriptions for the images. The HTML did not utilize Semantic tags such as: nav, header, content, footer, aside. These help create a more logical format that is easier to follow, as opposited to having every section just as a div. Additionally, in the CSS there were many elements/tags that could be condensed into one code (as opposed to seperated out into multiple) which makes the document much easier to read. Additionally, if a developer wanted to add an additional block of content, they would not have to recode all the CSS but rather just use the exisiting tags on new elements, making future editing faster. The CSS comments also make the document more readible for making further changes in the future. Lastly, the lines of code were reordered to match the flow of the page, and so that the order on the HTML is the same as the order on the CSS file.
